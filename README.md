Task 1: Reskin

Task 2: Change the Gameplay

1. Move items from the board to the bottom cells by tapping on them.

2. Once an item moves to a bottom cell, you can't move it back to the board.

3. If there are exactly three identical items in the bottom cells, they will be cleared.

4. Clear the board to win.

5. The player loses if he/she fills up all the bottom cells.

Requirements
1. The number of identical items on the initial board must be divisible by 3.

2. The bottom area contains 5 cells.

3. Show a simple winning screen when the player wins.

4. Show a simple losing screen when the player loses.

5. Create a simple Home screen with an 'Autoplay' button. Once clicked, the game will autoplay until it wins, with each action having a 0.5s delay.

6. Add an 'Auto Lose' button to the Home screen. Once clicked, the game will autoplay with the goal of losing, with each action having a 0.5s delay.

Task 3: Improve the gameplay

1. Ensure the initial board contains all types of fish.

2. Add an animation when an item moves from the board to the cells and another animation when identical items are cleared (scaling to 0).
---------------------------------------
X 3. Add a Time Attack Mode.

Add a 'Time Attack' button to the Home Screen to play a separate game mode.

The player no longer loses the game when the cells are filled.

The player can return an item from a cell to its initial position on the board by tapping it.

The player loses if they fail to clear the board within 1 minute.
